<p>The CDA filtering system is composed of a cylindrical carbon fibre airbox containing a washable filtering element. The choice of this composite material is due to the fact that carbon has low thermal conductivity allowing insulation from the engine heat to the aspirated air. Replacing the original airbox with the CDA&#44; fresh air is channelled directly to the filter&#44; thermally insulated inside the carbon airbox and then conveyed to the engine through an air flow deflector with minimum loss of power <br /><br />The CDA filtration system is connected to a frontal air intake via a flexible aluminum tube. Thanks to the dynamic air intake you get a real supercharging system that conveys fresh air to the air box at a speed and capacity greater than that of traditional systems. The air flow entering the dynamic air intake is accelerated further thanks to the air flow deflector inside the carbon fibre airbox. Dynamic over-boosting&#44; greater air flow&#44; higher pressure and colder air are the elements which help to significantly increase the performance of the engine both in terms of power and torque<br /><br />For any other info&#44; please see the FAQ page.</p>\

The air filter has the function of protecting the engine from all the elements (debris&#44; sand&#44; dust&#44; etc...) in the air flow to the engine during the aspiration phase. BMC air filter has a very low drop (i.e. the pressure difference between the air flow at the engine side and the one at the air entrance side) in order to enable the maximum air flow. <br /><br />BMC air filter can be regenerated and re-used.

<p>The CRF&#44; Carbon Racing Filter&#44; is BMC's new high performance sports air filter designed for road and competition vehicles. It features a 100% carbon fibre support structure with a cotton air filter.<br />The CRF has been designed and produced entirely by the BMC Racing and Advanced Composite Division&#44; which is wholly concerned with the development of air filters and aspiration systems for the racing world: Formula 1 / MotoGP One / World Superbike. The CRF has been created from extensive BMC knowledge acquired through more than 10 years of experience in the racing sector&#44; which has brought high level results and increased performance to super-sports engines.<br />The CRF air filter makes use of innovative technical solutions to optimize the flow dynamics of the direct air into the engine. The result is better air flow passage in the intake phase thereby maintaining constant air-box pressure.<br />The CRF filter was conceived with the objective of withstanding the vibrations and heat produced in movement both in normal road and intensive track use.<br />The CRF filter&#44; as are all BMC filters&#44; can be regenerated and reused. Once the saturation level has been reached the filter can be regenerated through a process of washing and re-oiling using the appropriate BMC washing kit.<br />For any other info&#44; please see the FAQ page or the dedicated sitewww.carbonracingfilter.com</p>\

<p>The panel / cylindrical air filter is commonly referred to as \"replacement air filter\". It is installed in the vehicle's original airbox to replace the OEM air filter. It is made of highly performing materials that allow an increased air flow combined with a more efficient filtration\" width=200 alt=\"Grafico prestazioni\" /><br />Air flow chart for a sample BMC air filter against an OEM paper filter<br /><i>Temperature 25Cdeg - Humidity 25% - Pressure 1020mbar</i> <br />Test ran with oem airbox&#44; and the related air flow constrictions.<br />This chart has a pure illustrative purpose and <u>does not</u> refer to the present filter.<br /><br />BMC air filters are produced using a \"Full Moulding\" system that enables the characteristic red filter to be realized from a single mould with no welded joints thus avoiding easy breakage. The rubber used in BMC air filtering systems has a long life&#44; is very durable and has optimum adhesion characteristics to all shapes of airboxes.<br /><br />BMC filters are made of a multi-layered cotton gauze soaked with low viscosity oil covered with an epoxy coated alloy mesh to ensure protection from petrol fumes and oxidization due to air humidity.<br /><br />All BMC air filters are pre-oiled&#44; and they can be washed and regenerated by using the appropriate BMC regeneration kit.<br /><br />For any other info&#44; please see the FAQ page.</p>\

<p>The panel / cylindrical air filter is commonly referred to as \"replacement air filter\". It is installed in the vehicle's original airbox to replace the OEM air filter. It is made of highly performing materials that allow an increased air flow combined with a more efficient filtration\" width=200 alt=\"Grafico prestazioni\" /><br />Air flow chart for a sample BMC air filter against an OEM paper filter<br /><i>Temperature 25Cdeg - Humidity 25% - Pressure 1020mbar</i> <br />Test ran with oem airbox&#44; and the related air flow constrictions.<br />This chart has a pure illustrative purpose and <u>does not</u> refer to the present filter.<br /><br />BMC air filters are produced using a \"Full Moulding\" system that enables the characteristic red filter to be realized from a single mould with no welded joints thus avoiding easy breakage. The rubber used in BMC air filtering systems has a long life&#44; is very durable and has optimum adhesion characteristics to all shapes of airboxes.<br /><br />BMC filters are made of a multi-layered cotton gauze soaked with low viscosity oil covered with an epoxy coated alloy mesh to ensure protection from petrol fumes and oxidization due to air humidity.<br /><br />All BMC air filters are pre-oiled&#44; and they can be washed and regenerated by using the appropriate BMC regeneration kit.<br /><br />For any other info&#44; please see the FAQ page.</p>\

<p>The panel / cylindrical air filter is commonly referred to as \"replacement air filter\". It is installed in the vehicle's original airbox to replace the OEM air filter. It is made of highly performing materials that allow an increased air flow combined with a more efficient filtration\" width=200 alt=\"Grafico prestazioni\" /><br />Air flow chart for a sample BMC air filter against an OEM paper filter<br /><i>Temperature 25Cdeg - Humidity 25% - Pressure 1020mbar</i> <br />Test ran with oem airbox&#44; and the related air flow constrictions.<br />This chart has a pure illustrative purpose and <u>does not</u> refer to the present filter.<br /><br />BMC air filters are produced using a \"Full Moulding\" system that enables the characteristic red filter to be realized from a single mould with no welded joints thus avoiding easy breakage. The rubber used in BMC air filtering systems has a long life&#44; is very durable and has optimum adhesion characteristics to all shapes of airboxes.<br /><br />BMC filters are made of a multi-layered cotton gauze soaked with low viscosity oil covered with an epoxy coated alloy mesh to ensure protection from petrol fumes and oxidization due to air humidity.<br /><br />All BMC air filters are pre-oiled&#44; and they can be washed and regenerated by using the appropriate BMC regeneration kit.<br /><br />For any other info&#44; please see the FAQ page.</p>\

<p>The panel / cylindrical air filter is commonly referred to as \"replacement air filter\". It is installed in the vehicle's original airbox to replace the OEM air filter. It is made of highly performing materials that allow an increased air flow combined with a more efficient filtration\" width=200 alt=\"Grafico prestazioni\" /><br />Air flow chart for a sample BMC air filter against an OEM paper filter<br /><em>Temperature 25C&deg; - Humidity 25% - Pressure 1020mbar</em> <br />Test ran with oem airbox&#44; and the related air flow constrictions.<br />This chart has a pure illustrative purpose and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">does not</span> refer to the present filter.<br /><br />BMC air filters are produced using a \"Full Moulding\" system that enables the characteristic red filter to be realized from a single mould with no welded joints thus avoiding easy breakage. The rubber used in BMC air filtering systems has a long life&#44; is very durable and has optimum adhesion characteristics to all shapes of airboxes.<br /><br />BMC filters are made of a multi-layered cotton gauze soaked with low viscosity oil covered with an epoxy coated alloy mesh to ensure protection from petrol fumes and oxidization due to air humidity.<br /><br />All BMC air filters are pre-oiled&#44; and they can be washed and regenerated by using the appropriate BMC regeneration kit.<br /><br />For any other info&#44; please see the FAQ page.</p>\

The special filtration mesh allows the production of filters with a power up to 700 HP without presenting problems of filter deformation.<br />BMC conical filters are available in two versions:<br />SA (Single Air) with simple lateral air flow - available in carbon top&#44; metal top and plastic top versions;<br /> TW (Twin Air) with central and lateral air flow - available in metal top and plastic top versions.<br />For any other info&#44; please see the FAQ page.</p>\

The special filtration mesh allows the production of filters with a power up to 700 HP without presenting problems of filter deformation.<br />BMC conical filters are available in two versions:<br />SA (Single Air) with simple lateral air flow - available in carbon top&#44; metal top and plastic top versions;<br /> TW (Twin Air) with central and lateral air flow - available in metal top and plastic top versions.<br />For any other info&#44; please see the FAQ page.</p>\
