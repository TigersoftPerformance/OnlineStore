        <p><strong>The Curvy Lady. &nbsp;Part of the quickest, easiest and most comfortable washing experience.</strong></p>\

<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Why NanoFibre?</strong></p>\
<p>Unlike a sponge, a NanoFibre&trade; Mitt is properly machine washable, making it a much safer alternative. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Sponges have thousands or millions of cells that catch and harbour debris and that debris is re-intoruced to your surface with every wash, along with ever increasing marring as the sponge fills with swirl inducing particles. &nbsp;The plastic used to make foam is also agreessive and creates additional marring, so even from the very first wipe, a NanoFibre Mitt is protecting your surfaces.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>\
<p>The Curvy Lady with its loose 'open end' NanoFibre&trade; will efficiently release debris when washed. &nbsp;The mitt is constructed with the highest quality so you can regularly clean the mitt during washes with your high pressure water unit or mains pressure water without damaging your curvy lady.</p>\
<p>The Curvy Lady has an astonishing amount of the smallest multi-split nanofibre packed together to reach 600 gsm making it super absorbant and incredibly effecive at extracting and holding large amounts of fine debris and oils. &nbsp;Recommended for use on all exterior surfaces such as paint, glass and plastics and even fabric soft tops.</p>\

        <p><strong>The Final Inspection Glass System&trade;, a revolutionary new way to easily and quickly clean glass including tinted glass without chemical and without streaks, smears or smudges.</strong></p>\
<p><strong></strong>All new for 2014, the NanoFibre&trade; Glass System&trade; is the best tool for glass maintenance.</p>\
<p>Clean glass is part of a safe and comfortable driving experience and it is important to have clean glass constantly. Maintaining glass should be simple and easy and the Glass System makes this so.</p>\
<p>With it's generously sized components, these tailored cloths will gently but effectively and efficiently remove weekly build-up of temporary contaminants from your vehicles glass surfaces without chemical.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Why NanoFibre?</strong></p>\
<p>The NanoFibre cloths deep clean and remove oils and dirt from the glass surface, leaving nothing to cause streaks or smears.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Performance, direction of use and glass cleaning information</strong></p>\
<p>The Glass System consists of two cloths, a Step 1 and a Step 2.</p>\
<p>Step 1 is a Dark Green coloured absorbent cloth used first, slightly damp, to deep clean glass by removing oils and dirt, pulling them away from the surface.</p>\
<p>Step 2 is a LIGHT GREEN tightly woven cloth used to remove any residual water on the glass surface and deliver a smear free finish.</p>\
<p>The best way to clean glass is to remove materials from the surface, not add to the surface, thus, using glass cleaning chemicals is only recommended if your glass is heavily soiled and/or the debris requires some chemical to assist to break down the debris.</p>\
<p>Smearing occurs as a result of material left on the surface, it is vital to use the best, most absorbent cloth to remove all materials from the glass surface in order to achieve the highest clarity and transmission without any ghosting or smearing from thin deposits left on the glass surface. It is also important to use a dry, tight woven cloth for finishing to atomise water and encourage evaporation of very small water particles to avoid visible watermarks.</p>\

        <p>The very best wax &amp; sealant 'Hand Pocket' Applicator<br />Use this safe and comfortable applicator to apply your favourite sealants and waxes.</p>\

<p><strong>Why a NanoFibre Applicator?</strong></p>\
<p>Unlike sponge, a NanoFibre&trade; applicator is properly machine washable, making it a much safer alternative.<br />Why?<br /> Sponges have thousands or millions of cells that catch and harbour debris and that debris is re-introduced to your surface with every wipe, along with ever increasing marring as the sponge fills with swirl inducing particles. &nbsp;The plastic used to make foam is also agreessive and creates additional marring, so even from the very first wipe, a NanoFibre applicator is protecting your surfaces.</p>\
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>\
<p>This applicator is designed to prime faster while absorbing less product. It loads quickly with very little product, but primes evenly and distributes consistently with ease.</p>\
<p>It has a small, tight 'Hand Pocket' designed to reduce fatigue and a small surface area to reduce unnecessary product absorption and loss which is important when using expensive sealants or waxes.</p>\
<p>Very high quality NanoFibre with durable, double foam core.</p>\
<p>The applicator consists entirely of Nanofibre with the exception of the foam core. &nbsp;Edging is Nanofibre, not silk, rayon, nylon, cotton or any other organic materials that mark glossy surfaces.</p>\
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\
<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>\
<p>Use the hand pocket applicator in conjunction with the drections on the product you are using it with. &nbsp;Usually, for applying sealants and waxes, a back and forth motion is recommended and overlapping grid for efficiency.</p>\
<p>The 'Hand Pocket' applicator is reversible, simply pull the hand pocket over the top of the applicator&nbsp;</p>\

        <p>Hand Pocket Applicator - Dressing Use the Blue Hand Pocket Applicator as a dedicated applicator for Dressing Interior Plastics with a Vinyl Dressing/Protectant or to apply other Dressings to plastic, Rubber &amp; Vinyl materials. &nbsp;Blue is also the wheel colour code and thus, this applicator is recommended to be used for application of protective sealants/waxes to wheels such as <a title=\"Full Metal Jacket Spray Wax\" href=\"http://finalins.testpad.com.au/full-metal-jacket-spray-wax\" target=\"_blank\">Full Metal Jacket Spray Wax</a>.</p>\

<p>The Pad Converter is also useful for those awkward areas or for polishing using a different angle of position. &nbsp;Conventional drills are not shaped like rotary or random orbital polishers and are usually significantly slimmer, this is often an alternative that comes in very handy for professional detailers to avoid potential risk of the tool coming into contact with the vehicle.</p>\

        <p><strong>Full Metal Jacket&trade; Spray Wax&nbsp;is the super-hydrophobic, oleophobic, nano-polymer sealant that inhibits 99% of UV rays from penetrating the coating for it's life that you have been searching for.</strong><br /> <strong>One of very few sealants, Full Metal Jacket&trade; is named as such for its unique ability to&nbsp;adhere well to, and protect very well, all exterior surfaces of the vehicle to which it is applied.</strong><br /> <strong>No other sealant available feels, looks and protects quite like a Full Metal Jacket&trade; Spray Wax layer.</strong></p>\
<p>Full Metal Jacket&trade; Spray Wax may be used as a stand alone sealant and your only form of paint protection or as a maintenance spray for your&nbsp;Full Metal Jacket&trade; Paint Protection layer. Full Metal Jacket&nbsp;Spray Wax is the easy-to-use version of the famous Full Metal Jacket&trade; Paint Protection.</p>\
<p>Full Metal Jacket&trade; is used in all sectors of the transport industry, for aviation purposes, for interstate trucks and for limosenes, but&nbsp;Full Metal Jacket&trade; is also used to protect surfaces such as splash backs, solar panels, bench tops and more for its ability to provide easy-cleaning and self cleaning characteristics.</p>\

<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Full Metal Jacket&trade; Spray Wax applicable to the following materials</strong><br /> - Matte and Satin paint finishes<br /> - Gloss, matte and satin vinyl wrap / PU stone chip protection films<br /> - Chrome / Electroplate safe<br /> - Glass including Tint<br /> - Polycarbonate (headlights) and Acrylic (tail lights)</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Directions of Use</strong><br /> There are two methods for application of Full Metal Jacket Spray Wax. &nbsp;The first yields a thicker layer, the second is faster, easier and requires less product and material. &nbsp;Final Inspection recommend to apply the first layer with the first method and the second and subsequent layers with the second method as maintenance of your sacrificial protection layer. &nbsp;If you are maintaining a <a title=\"Full Metal Jacket - Final Inspection Car Care Products\" href=\"http://www.finalinspection.com.au/full-metal-jacket-paint-protection-30ml-1-fl-oz\">Full Metal Jacket Paint Protection</a> coating, we recommend only the second method as maintenance.</p>\
<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>\
<p>1. Shake bottle well. &nbsp;Also apply to clean and dry surfaces.</p>\
<p>2.&nbsp;Spray 3-6 pumps of Full Metal Jacket Spray Wax onto a <a title=\"NanoFibre&trade; Wax Applicator - Final Inspection Car Care Products\" href=\"http://www.finalinspection.com.au/hand-pocket-applicator-wax\">NanoFibre Paintwork Applicator</a> and apply to paint, glass or chrome. &nbsp;Allow 2 minutes to bond, then begin to remove with a <a title=\"NanoFibre&trade; Paintwork Cloth - Final Inspection Car Care Products\" href=\"http://www.finalinspection.com.au/paint-nanofibre-cloth\">NanoFibre Paintwork Cloth</a>, turning cloth regularly until a high gloss is achieved.</p>\
<p>3. All surfaces should feel significantly slicker and appear glossier after application. &nbsp;Allow 72 hours before next application.</p>\
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>\
<p>1. Shake bottle well. &nbsp;Also apply to clean and dry surfaces.</p>\
<p>2. Spray Full Metal Jacket directly onto paint, glass or chrome and immediately begin to spread and remove with a <a title=\"NanoFibre&trade; Paintwork Cloth - Final Inspection Car Care Products\" href=\"http://www.finalinspection.com.au/paint-nanofibre-cloth\">NanoFibre Paintwork Cloth</a>, turning cloth regularly until a high gloss is achieved.</p>\
<p>3. All surfaces should feel significantly slicker and appear glossier after application. &nbsp;Allow 72 hours before next application.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Full Metal Jacket&trade; Spray Wax does not require a high skill level and whilst correct application of any sealant is important, applying Full Metal Jacket&trade; Spray Wax correctly is very easy to achieve.</p>\
<p>One layer of Full Metal Jacket will typically last 2-3 months, multiple layers (3 or more) applied 1 week apart will yield upto 1 year of protection.</p>\
<p>Full Metal Jacket Spray Wax is Matt Paint Safe and will not adjust sheen on matt or satin surfaces when used correctly.</p>\
<p>Full Metal Jacket exhibits excellent coverage. Only a tiny amount of Full Metal Jacket is required to consistently cover even large vehicles. Typically, only 25ml of Full Metal Jacket will be required to cover a standard sized vehicle.</p>\

        <p><strong>The Final Inspection Glass System&trade;, a revolutionary new way to easily and quickly clean glass including tinted glass without chemical and without streaks, smears or smudges.</strong></p>\
<p><strong></strong>All new for 2014, the NanoFibre&trade; Glass System&trade; is the best tool for glass maintenance.</p>\
<p>Clean glass is part of a safe and comfortable driving experience and it is important to have clean glass constantly. Maintaining glass should be simple and easy and the Glass System makes this so.</p>\
<p>With it's generously sized components, these tailored cloths will gently but effectively and efficiently remove weekly build-up of temporary contaminants from your vehicles glass surfaces without chemical.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Why NanoFibre?</strong></p>\
<p>The NanoFibre cloths deep clean and remove oils and dirt from the glass surface, leaving nothing to cause streaks or smears.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Performance, direction of use and glass cleaning information</strong></p>\
<p>The Glass System consists of two cloths, a Step 1 and a Step 2.</p>\
<p>Step 1 is a Dark Green coloured absorbent cloth used first, slightly damp, to deep clean glass by removing oils and dirt, pulling them away from the surface.</p>\
<p>Step 2 is a LIGHT GREEN tightly woven cloth used to remove any residual water on the glass surface and deliver a smear free finish.</p>\
<p>The best way to clean glass is to remove materials from the surface, not add to the surface, thus, using glass cleaning chemicals is only recommended if your glass is heavily soiled and/or the debris requires some chemical to assist to break down the debris.</p>\
<p>Smearing occurs as a result of material left on the surface, it is vital to use the best, most absorbent cloth to remove all materials from the glass surface in order to achieve the highest clarity and transmission without any ghosting or smearing from thin deposits left on the glass surface. It is also important to use a dry, tight woven cloth for finishing to atomise water and encourage evaporation of very small water particles to avoid visible watermarks.</p>\

<p>The Eraser&trade; uses polymers to pull away surface contaminants without aggressive mechanical action.<br /> The repetitious movement of claying a car severely reduces efficiency as it fatigues the detailer.<br /> The Eraser&trade; solves this issue by utilising a machine to carry out all the leg work.<br /> The Eraser&trade; also reduces marring significantly and provides a significantly higher rate of contamination removal.</p>\
<p>The Eraser&trade; is for random orbital machine use.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Directions of use</strong><br /> <strong></strong>For best results;</p>\
<p>1. Only use the Eraser&trade; on a clean, dry vehicle and only work one panel at a time.</p>\
<p>2. Lubricate panel with Final Inspection Lube&trade;</p>\
<p>3. Work the Eraser&trade; at a speed of approximately 5ooo opm moving the machine slowly to ensure thorough cleaning.</p>\
<p>4. Remove lubricant immediately after panel has been decontaminated.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Surface decontamination with The Eraser&trade; (mechanical decontamination) should always be followed by a sub-surface (chemical) decontamination.

<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Maintenance &amp; FAQ</strong><br /><strong></strong>For best results, keep the Eraser&trade; clean, and free of dust. &nbsp;Clean it with lubricant before the next use by spraying lubricant onto the pad and removing the lubricant (along with any dust) by wiping the face with a paintwork cloth.</p>\

        <p><strong>The Curvy Lady. &nbsp;Part of the quickest, easiest and most comfortable washing experience.</strong></p>\
<p><strong></strong>All new for 2013, the NanoFibre&trade; 'Curvy Lady' Wash Mitt is part of, arguably, the most important part of exterior maintaince.</p>\
<p>With it's generous and comfortable shape and size, this tailored moquet weave mitt will gently but effectively and efficiently remove weekly build-up of temporary contaminants from your vehicles surfaces.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Why NanoFibre?</strong></p>\
<p>Unlike a sponge, a NanoFibre&trade; Mitt is properly machine washable, making it a much safer alternative. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Sponges have thousands or millions of cells that catch and harbour debris and that debris is re-intoruced to your surface with every wash, along with ever increasing marring as the sponge fills with swirl inducing particles. &nbsp;The plastic used to make foam is also agreessive and creates additional marring, so even from the very first wipe, a NanoFibre Mitt is protecting your surfaces.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>\
<p>The Curvy Lady with its loose 'open end' NanoFibre&trade; will efficiently release debris when washed. &nbsp;The mitt is constructed with the highest quality so you can regularly clean the mitt during washes with your high pressure water unit or mains pressure water without damaging your curvy lady.</p>\
<p>The Curvy Lady has an astonishing amount of the smallest multi-split nanofibre packed together to reach 600 gsm making it super absorbant and incredibly effecive at extracting and holding large amounts of fine debris and oils. &nbsp;Recommended for use on all exterior surfaces such as paint, glass and plastics and even fabric soft tops.</p>\
<p>The NanoFibre&trade; Wash Mitt features robust hand sewn polyester overlocking which is completely concealed inside the mitt.</p>\

<p>&nbsp;Unlike a Chamois, a Microfibre Drying Towel is properly machine washable, making it a much safer alternative.</p>\
<p>Unlike a Leather or PVC chamois, no debris is trapped in the fibres and microfibre will not harbour bacteria like those materials, especially because it can be washed with an anti-bacterial wash &amp; dried in the same way most fabrics are.</p>\
<p>Unlike a chamois, in a Wash, any trapped debris is easily removed so no reintroduction of that debris occurs the next time you use the towel to dry your painted surfaces.</p>\

<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong><strong><strong>Leather Clean Gel&trade;</strong></strong>&nbsp;delivers perfect results on the following materials</strong></p>\
<p>- All types of aniline leather<br />- All types of semi-aniline leather (most very high-end luxury vehicles)<br />- All types of PU coated leather&nbsp;(most mass-produced vehicles)</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>When should I clean my leather?</strong></p>\
<p>You should clean leather when it is required. &nbsp;Unlike feeding which is recommended once per month regardless of use, there are no set time intervals for leather cleaning, instead, we recommend to maintain clean leather as it is necessary.</p>\
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\
<p><strong>Why is a dedicated <strong>cleaner</strong>&nbsp;and feeder better than an all in one product?</strong></p>\
<p>Replacing hydration at the same time as cleaning is a cumbersome and thus inefficient method of maintaining leather.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Dedicated cleaners should be used to remove debris before a moisturiser, designed to sink deep into the leather, is applied.</p>\
<p>It is highly recommended to clean leather, however, Final Inspection 'Feed' does contain a very small amount of cleaners designed to remove only very light soiling.</p>\
<p>For instanace, for vehicles that aren't very dirty and/or aren't used very often, it will be unnecessary to use a dedicated cleaner often.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>May I use leather clean in my home or office?</strong></p>\
<p>Of course, leather 'Feed' may be used on all types of leather as part of good maintenance, seperate products are not required for leather sofas etc.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Directions of use</strong><br /> <span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Video instructions available on the next tab</span></p>\
<p>1.&nbsp;Make sure all leather surfaces are clean and dry. &nbsp;If heavily soiled, first clean with Final Inspection Leather Clean Gel&trade;. &nbsp;If lightly dusty or dirty, wipe surfaces clean with a slightly damp Final Inspection NanoFibre&nbsp;Interior Cloth&trade;&nbsp;and allow to dry.</p>\
<p>2. For best results, apply a coin-sized amount of leather Feed&trade; onto a clean and dry Final Inspection NanoFibre Interior Applicator&trade; (yellow) and prime the applicator by spreading the feed around and into the applicator.<br /><br />3. Do not remove leather 'Feed' from leather, instead, allow upto 15min for leather to accept nourishment and return to a dry state with no gloss. &nbsp;If leather returns dry in less than 5mins, it may require more hydration, it is recommended to re-apply by carrying out processes in step 2.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\

        <p><strong>The world's leather moisturiser, <strong>Feed&trade;</strong>&nbsp;by Final Inspection is a vey high quality leather conditioner designed to hydrate all types of leather keeping them soft and supple. &nbsp;Packed with the same tanning oils used to initially condition leather in the manufacturing proces, <strong>Feed&trade;</strong>&nbsp;lends a fresh, genuine leather look, smell and&nbsp;</strong><strong>feel.</strong></p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Leather Feed&trade; delivers perfect results on the following materials</strong></p>\
<p>- All types of aniline leather<br />- All types of semi-aniline leather (most very high-end luxury vehicles)<br />- All types of PU coated leather&nbsp;(most mass-produced vehicles)</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>When should I re-hydrate to my leather?</strong></p>\
<p>You should replace lost moisutre every month regardless of how much or little use the vehicle has.</p>\
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\
<p><strong>Why is a dedicated feeder and cleaner better than an all in one product?</strong></p>\

<p>Of course, Leather 'Feed' may be used on all types of leather as part of good maintenance, separate products are not required for leather sofas etc.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>May I 'feed' vinyl or leatherette?</strong></p>\
<p>Whilst Final Inspection Leather Feed will not damage vinyl, plastic, MB Tech or any other kind of leatherette, it is futile feeding these synthetic materials.</p>\
<p>Leather Feed won't be accepted by these materials and the surfaces will most likely remain greasy, the product will then require removal or will be removed by clothing.</p>\
<p>Final Inspection suggests not moisturising vinyls with feed as well as cleaning them with Leather Clean Gel, instead, clean synthetic materials with Interior Cleanse for its superior cleaning power and reduced cost. &nbsp;Do not clean leather with Interior Cleanse.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Directions of use</strong></p>\
<p>1.&nbsp;Make sure all leather surfaces are clean and dry. &nbsp;If heavily soiled, first clean with Final Inspection Leather Clean Gel&trade;. &nbsp;If lightly dusty or dirty, wipe surfaces clean with a slightly damp Final Inspection NanoFibre&nbsp;Interior Cloth&trade;&nbsp;and allow to dry.</p>\

Do not remove leather 'Feed' from leather, instead, allow up to 15min for leather to accept nourishment and return to a dry state with no gloss. &nbsp;If leather returns dry in less than 5mins, it may require more hydration, it is recommended to re-apply by carrying out processes in step 2.</p>\

        <p>Hand Pocket Applicator - Leather The Leather Hand Pocket Applicator makes applying Leather Feed a breeze. The Low Pile Weave doesn't unnecessarily absorb product that eventually is wasted. The Low Pile also allows the Hand Pocket to glide across the rough Leather surface instead of gripping. It does however have enough pile to evenly distribute the Feeding product onto Leather surfaces. For use with all Leather Feeding/Conditioning/Moisturising products that are in paste or thicker liquid form.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>The very best interior 'hand pocket' applicator for cleaning or application of leather preservers such as 'feed'.<br /><br /></p>\

<p><strong>Why a NanoFibre Applicator?</strong></p>\
<p>Unlike sponge, a NanoFibre&trade; applicator is properly machine washable, making it a much safer alternative.<br />Why?<br />Sponges have thousands or millions of cells that catch and harbour debris and that debris is re-introduced to your surface with every wipe, along with ever increasing marring as the sponge fills with swirl inducing particles. &nbsp;The plastic used to make foam is also agreessive and creates additional marring, so even from the very first wipe, a NanoFibre applicator is protecting your surfaces.</p>\
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>\
<p>This applicator is designed to prime faster while absorbing less product. It loads quickly with very little product, but primes evenly and re-distributes products such as 'feed' consistently with ease.</p>\
<p>It has a small, tight 'Hand Pocket' designed to reduce fatigue and a small surface area to reduce unnecessary product absorption and loss which is important when using expensive products.</p>\
<p>Very high quality NanoFibre with durable, double foam core.</p>\
<p>The applicator consists entirely of Nanofibre with the exception of the foam core. &nbsp;Edging is Nanofibre, not silk, rayon, nylon, cotton or any other organic materials that mark glossy surfaces. &nbsp;You will find no nasty 'edgeless' technology in any of our NanoFibre products.</p>\
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\
<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>\
<p>Use the hand pocket applicator in conjunction with the drections on the product you are using it with. &nbsp;Usually, for applying leather conditioners, a slightly overlapping&nbsp;back and forth motion is recommended.</p>\
<p>The 'Hand Pocket' applicator is reversible, simply pull the hand pocket over the top of the applicator&nbsp;</p>\
