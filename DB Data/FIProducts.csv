That may surprise you. Afterall&#44 everyone knows how to wash a car&#44 right? Unfortunately&#44 that is not the case. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Next time you are walking through a car park on a sunny day&#44 look at the sun's reflection in the bonnets of some of the cars there. On most cars&#44 you will notice 'swirl' marks all over the paint. They are far more noticeable on dark cars than on white or silver cars. These swirls are actually very small scratches all over the paint&#44 and they are caused by one main culprit: Incorrect Washing Technique. As you can see&#44 all of those swirls scatter the light everywhere&#44 which makes the paintwork look dull and old. They can only be removed through intensive polishing. Using this kit&#44 and the washing method below is the best way that we know how to prevent swirls in paintwork for as long as possible. We use exactly this technique in-house</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>What's included in the kit?</p></span><p><strong>1 x Nanofibre Paintwork Cloth:</strong> Used exclusively for wiping product from paintwork.

Even if it is parked under cover&#44 dust is landing on it. Even seconds after washing your car&#44 dust is landing on it.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Every time you touch your car with your fingers&#44 or your brush along side the car with your clothes&#44 you are grinding very fine pieces of dust and dirt into the paint&#44 and that causes many very tiny scratches. Over time&#44 these scratches become the swirls that you see in so many cars.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>It is impossible to avoid swirls completely&#44 for example when you wash the car you need to touch it&#44 and that in itself will cause swirls. All you can do is minimise the swirls by avoiding touching the paint unless absolutely necessary&#44 and then only doing so with the finest nanofibre cloths.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>It follows then that to keep swirls and scratches at bay&#44 you need to do everything you can to prevent grinding dust into the paint. The purpose of this kit is to allow you to do exactly that.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionTitle\"">Washing Instructions</span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Clean Wheel Arches</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>It is a good idea to regularly clean your Wheel Arches to stop build up of dirt on these plastics (or sound deadening fabric on some models)</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Rinse Wheels & Wheel Arches to reduce the temperature of the surfaces.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Spray General Purpose Cleaner onto these plastics or fabric as well as your tyres to remove and stop build up of old Tyre Dressing.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Agitate if necessary.

It is almost pH Neutral&#44 and so it is very gentle on painted and polished wheels&#44 and yet it makes very short work indeed of brake dust. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>For normal brake dust build-up over a week or 2&#44 all you need to do is spray some PWC onto the wheels&#44 wait a few minutes&#44 and then hose it off. PWC is very effective at dissolving the brake dust and 99% of it will be removed when rinsing the wheel. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>NOTE: It is very easy to spray “down” at the wheel only&#44 don't forget to spray up and from side to side as well&#44 to ensure that you get PWC into all nooks and crannies. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>For brake dust that is old and cooked on&#44 or to clean the insides of the wheels&#44 use the supplied Wheel Brush to agitate the PWC on the wheel before hosing off. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Rinse wheels and tyres thoroughly when you rinse down the car.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Initial Rinse</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>The aim of Rinsing the car first is to simply remove as much of the dirt as is possible before we physically touch the car&#44 thereby minimising scratches and swirls.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Set up everything ready to go&#44 make sure that the high pressure washer is connected up and turned on. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Make sure that you have cleaned the wheels&#44 tyres and arches first.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Rinse the whole car from top to bottom with the high pressure washer. Take your time&#44 hold the nozzle about 15 – 20 cm from the paint&#44 don't go too much closer though. Don't forget to do up under the wheel arches&#44 and under the sills all around the car. Give the wheels and tyres a very good rinse to remove the PWC and all of the brake dust that it loosened up.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Washing the Paintwork</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>As was stressed earlier&#44 swirls cannot be completely avoided&#44 all we can do is be diligent and take care when washing the car to minimise the harm. The Two golden rules you need to follow are:</p></span><ol class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionOrderedList\"" ><li>Only use the Three Premium Final Inspection Nano-fibre cloths to touch the paintwork on your car. Specifcally&#44 that includes the Wash Mitts&#44 the Waffle Weave Drying Towel&#44 and the Paintwork Nanofibre cloths. You should avoid contact with your cars paint with anything other than those three products.</li><li>Use the Two Bucket Method to wash your car. In a nutshell&#44 fill both buckets with fresh clean water&#44 and then nominate one as the 'fresh water' bucket&#44 and the other as the 'rinse' bucket. To wash a panel&#44 pick up some fresh water in the Wash Mitt from fresh water bucket&#44 and spray 1 or 2 sprays of PPBS directly onto the Wash Mitt. After you have washed the panel&#44 thoroughly rinse the wash mitt in the rinse bucket to remove all of the dirt from the mitt&#44 wring it out&#44 and then pick up fresh water from the fresh water bucket to wash the next panel. After washing the car&#44 the rinse bucket should be dirty&#44 but the wash bucket should be perfectly clean.</li></ol><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>There are 2 Mitts included in this kit&#44 you should use both to wash the car. Do half the car with one&#44 and half the car with the other. This just prevents one Wash Mitt from becoming too dirty</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>You should always work from top to bottom&#44 and from the cleanest to the dirtiest places. No point in picking up the dirt from behind the wheel arches&#44 and then smearing it all over the bonnet and causing swirls!</p></span><ol class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionOrderedList\"" ><li>Using the first Wash Mitt&#44 wash the Turret (ie the roof&#44 pillars and glass)&#44 starting with the paint&#44 finishing with the glass&#44 and then wash the Bonnet&#44 Boot&#44 Back and finally the front of the car IN THAT ORDER! (cleanest to dirtiest)</li><li>Using the second Wash Mitt&#44Wash the sides of the car. Wash the top half of one side first&#44 then the top half of the other side&#44 and then do the lower halves&#44 and again in that order</li></ol><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>The method is simple. Start with a clean wash mitt&#44 and put it into the fresh water bucket to pick up fresh water. Spray 1 or 2 sprays (about 2ml) of PPBS (Paint Pampering Body Shampoo) onto the Wash Mott&#44 and wash one panel or less. Do not scrub&#44 do not apply pressure&#44 do not use circular motions&#44 and do not overlap your strokes&#44 you only need to touch each piece of paint once! So simply wipe over back and forth. Each panel should take in the order of 5 to 10 seconds. If you find that dirt is stuck on and cannot be removed that easily&#44 then this is a good indication that you need more wax!</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>After you have completed each panel (or part panel)&#44 rinse the wash mitt out in the rinse bucket  thoroughly&#44 wring it out&#44 and then pick up fresh clean water from the fresh water bucket and do the next panel. If you are using more than one mitt to wash the car&#44 swap mitts after each section</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Final Rinse</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Don't be fooled&#44 there is still a fair amount of dirt on your car&#44 it is caught up in the emulsion formed with the shampoo. The purpose of this final rinse is to remove the leftover shampoo (and all of the dirt that it has trapped) form the car. Rinse down the panels from top to bottom&#44 but pay special attention to nooks&#44 crannies&#44 panel gaps etc&#44 as they will be full of shampoo (and therefore dirt).</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Drying the car</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Use the WWDT (Final Inspection Waffle Weave Drying Towel) to dry the car. Fold the towel into eight (so you have 16 clean sides to use) and basically use one side to dry each panel. If the towel gets water-logged&#44 simply ring it out. Be careful about letting any parts of the towel touch the ground&#44 especially when you are drying the bottom parts of the car&#44 as this will just pick up dirt that you will then grind into your paint. Only dry your paint and trim with the WWDT&#44 not the wheels</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Finishing the wheels</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Use the supplied Wheel Nanofibre Cloth  and a little Gloss Boost sprayed onto the wheel to quickly go over each wheel and remove all traces of brake dust. Make sure that you get into all the nooks and crannies&#44 and get down low and look up so you can see all the bits you missed from looking from above. You should have removed 99% of all brake dust earlier&#44 this last step is essentially to pick up the last 1% and dry the wheels</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Door Jambs</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>This is probably the most commonly overlooked part of washing your car&#44 clean door jambs make all of the difference in the perception of how clean the car is. Also&#44 if there is dirt caught in the jambs&#44 it will come out after you have finished washing the car and leave dirt trails everywhere!</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Simply spray a little Gloss Boost onto the Jamb Cloth and wipe the dirt and grease from all of the door jambs&#44 and of course the inside painted areas of your doors. Don't forget to do the bonnet&#44 boot and fuel flap as well&#44 they all trap dirt!</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Apply Gloss Boost</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>If you want your freshly washed car to have a little extra sparkle and 'pop'&#44 then simply spend another 5 minutes and go over the whole car from top to bottom using Final Inspection Gloss Boost&#44 and a Microfibre Paint Cloth.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Fold the Microfibre cloth into 4. We only ever use the plush side of the cloth on the paint&#44 never the 'hard' side. If you fold the cloth into 4&#44 so that you have 2 plush sides on the outside&#44 use one side as the 'wet side' and the other as the 'dry side'</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Simply spray a very small amount of Gloss Boost onto a panel (Very Important: Less is more here&#44 you only need just one or two sprays and no more!) and then spread it over the panel evenly using the wet side of the cloth. Don't scrub! Don't apply any pressure! You are simply spreading the Gloss Boost evenly! Then&#44 straight away&#44 turn the cloth over and buff the panel dry with the dry side. Repeat this process over the whole car. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Spending 5 minutes to apply Gloss Boost to your car after washing will really add another dimension to how shiny your car will look.</p></span></div>",Final Inspection,Y,\N

When used in conjunction with our recommended washing technique&#44 this kit will help you keep the paint swirl and blemish free. What's more&#44 it takes no more than 5 minutes after you have washed your car!</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Every car should have a protective layer of wax on it at all times. Doing so gives you the following benefits:</p></span><ul class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionUnorderedList\"" ><li>It protects your paintwork from the acids in Bird Poo&#44 which would otherwise easily etch into the paint.</li><li>It protects your paintwork from UV radiation&#44 which would otherwise burn your clear coat&#44 and leave it brittle&#44 and subject to cracking and peeling.</li><li>It keeps your car looking clean for longer. People often claim that dark cars are harder to keep clean&#44 but that is only true if wax is not used. With adequate wax protection&#44 dirt will find it much harder to stick to the surface&#44 and most of it will wash off in the rain&#44 so your car looks cleaner for longer</li></ul><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>The primary reason that people don't keep wax protection on their cars is that it takes too long to apply. That certainly USED to be the case&#44 but with the latest Final Inspection products&#44 that problem has been solved. A layer of wax can be applied in as little as 5 minutes!</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>When do I use this kit?</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>This kit is only to be used immediately after washing your car&#44 and not at any other time*.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>For argument's sake&#44 lets say that you wash your car every fortnight&#44 or 26 times in a year. For the first 3 washes&#44 apply a layer of Full Metal Jacket Spray Wax. So after the first 3 washes&#44 you will have 3 strong layers of wax to protect your paint. This will be enough to give your car protection now for 6 to 12 months&#44 however you can keep on applying FMJSW after every wash&#44 or even after every second wash&#44 to keep it looking mint</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>What's included in the kit?</p></span><p><strong>2 x Paintwork Nanofibre Cloths:</strong> The Paintwork Nanofibre Cloth has a hard side and a soft side. NEVER use the hard side&#44 we only ever use the soft side to touch paintwork. Fold the cloth into 4 so that you have 2 soft sides. If you fold the other way&#44 you have 2 fresh soft sides. Cloths can be washed in the washing machine on the Synthetics cycle (preferably with a microfibre wash) and will last for many years if looked after.</p><p><strong>1 x Full Metal Jacket Spray Wax 275ml:</strong> One of the best spray-waxes on the market today. Application is a simple 5 minute process&#44 and will provide protection to your car's paint for months at a time. Provides essential protection againt bird-poo and UV radiation&#44 and adds a nice gloss finish. It can be used on paint&#44 glass (not windscreen) rubber and plastic.</p><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>So are you gonna tell me how to use it&#44 or what?</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>PLEASE NOTE: As with all Final Inspection products&#44 a little goes a very long way. Most people believe that if a little bit does a good job&#44 then more must be better&#44 but this is not the case with FI products&#44 they are designed to be used sparingly. Using too much will make the products more difficult to use. If you are finding it difficult to buff off either of the products in this kit&#44 then you are using too much product! Try using half that amount.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>After every wash&#44 spend just 5 minutes to apply a layer of FMJSW. FMJSW only needs to be used the first 3 times&#44 or when more wax is required&#44 but using it more often will keep it looking fresh</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>FMJSW is applied as follows:</p></span><ol class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionOrderedList\"" ><li>Fold the Paintwork Nanofibre Cloth into 4&#44 so that you have 2 soft sides. Nominally&#44 one side will be the 'dry' side&#44 and the other side will be the 'Wet' side.</li><li>Spray a little product directly onto a panel. One or 2 sprays is all that it takes per panel&#44 if you use too much it will be hard to buff off later.</li><li>Use the 'Wet' side of the cloth to spread the product evenly over the panel. This side of the cloth will now be Wet!</li><li>Flip the cloth over and buff the surface clean with the 'Dry' side of the cloth.</li><li>Repeat for every panel</li></ol><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Once you have done this a couple of times and figured out how little product to use&#44 you will be able to do the whole car in around 5 minutes every time.</p></span></div>",Final Inspection,Y,\N

That may surprise you. Afterall&#44 everyone knows how to wash a car&#44 right? Unfortunately&#44 that is not the case. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Next time you are walking through a car park on a sunny day&#44 look at the sun's reflection in the bonnets of some of the cars there. On most cars&#44 you will notice 'swirl' marks all over the paint. They are far more noticeable on dark cars than on white or silver cars. These swirls are actually very small scratches all over the paint&#44 and they are caused by one main culprit: Incorrect Washing Technique. As you can see&#44 all of those swirls scatter the light everywhere&#44 which makes the paintwork look dull and old. They can only be removed through intensive polishing. Using this kit&#44 and the washing method below is the best way that we know how to prevent swirls in paintwork for as long as possible. We use exactly this technique in-house</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>What's included in the kit?</p></span><p><strong>1 x Nanofibre Paintwork Cloth:</strong> Used exclusively for wiping product from paintwork. Do not use these cloths for anything else. These clothes have a hard side and a soft side&#44 we only ever use the soft side. These clothes are best used folded into 4&#44 with 2 soft sides showing</p><p><strong>1 x Nanofibre Wash Mitt:</strong> Used to wash the car. Use only on paint&#44 plastics and glass&#44 but do not use on wheels&#44 unless you keep one exclusively for that purpose</p><p><strong>1 x Waffle Weave Drying Towel (WWDT):</strong> Microfibre cloth for drying the car.</p><p><strong>1 x Nanofibre Wheel Cloth:</strong> Cloth used exclusively for wiping down wheels</p><p><strong>1 x Paint Pampering Body Shampoo (PPBS) 500ml:</strong> pH Neutral body shampoo (car wash)</p><p><strong>1 x Power Wheel Cleaner (PWC) 500ml:</strong> Dissolves brake dust from wheels</p><p><strong>1 x Gloss Boost (GB) 125ml:</strong> Used to add a high-gloss finish after washing. Also useful for removing bird poo&#44 and for cleaning door jambs</p><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>The harsh reality</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Every second of every day&#44 dust in the air is landing on your car. Even if it is parked under cover&#44 dust is landing on it. Even seconds after washing your car&#44 dust is landing on it.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Every time you touch your car with your fingers&#44 or your brush along side the car with your clothes&#44 you are grinding very fine pieces of dust and dirt into the paint&#44 and that causes many very tiny scratches. Over time&#44 these scratches become the swirls that you see in so many cars.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>It is impossible to avoid swirls completely&#44 for example when you wash the car you need to touch it&#44 and that in itself will cause swirls. All you can do is minimise the swirls by avoiding touching the paint unless absolutely necessary&#44 and then only doing so with the finest nanofibre cloths.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>It follows then that to keep swirls and scratches at bay&#44 you need to do everything you can to prevent grinding dust into the paint. The purpose of this kit is to allow you to do exactly that.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionTitle\"">Washing Instructions</span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Clean Wheels and Tyres</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Final Inspection's Power Wheel Clean (PWC) is probably the best wheel cleaner on the planet today. It is almost pH Neutral&#44 and so it is very gentle on painted and polished wheels&#44 and yet it makes very short work indeed of brake dust. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>For normal brake dust build-up over a week or 2&#44 all you need to do is spray some PWC onto the wheels&#44 wait a few minutes&#44 and then hose it off. PWC is very effective at dissolving the brake dust and 99% of it will be removed when rinsing the wheel. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>NOTE: It is very easy to spray “down” at the wheel only&#44 don't forget to spray up and from side to side as well&#44 to ensure that you get PWC into all nooks and crannies. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Rinse wheels and tyres thoroughly when you rinse down the car.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Initial Rinse</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>The aim of Rinsing the car first is to simply remove as much of the dirt as is possible before we physically touch the car&#44 thereby minimising scratches and swirls.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Set up everything ready to go&#44 make sure that the high pressure washer is connected up and turned on. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Make sure that you have cleaned the wheels&#44 tyres and arches first.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Rinse the whole car from top to bottom with the high pressure washer. Take your time&#44 hold the nozzle about 15 – 20 cm from the paint&#44 don't go too much closer though. Don't forget to do up under the wheel arches&#44 and under the sills all around the car. Give the wheels and tyres a very good rinse to remove the PWC and all of the brake dust that it loosened up.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Washing the Paintwork</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>As was stressed earlier&#44 swirls cannot be completely avoided&#44 all we can do is be diligent and take care when washing the car to minimise the harm. The Two golden rules you need to follow are:</p></span><ol class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionOrderedList\"" ><li>Only use the Three Premium Final Inspection Nano-fibre cloths to touch the paintwork on your car. Specifcally&#44 that includes the Wash Mitts&#44 the Waffle Weave Drying Towel&#44 and the Paintwork Nanofibre cloths. You should avoid contact with your cars paint with anything other than those three products.</li><li>Use the Two Bucket Method to wash your car. In a nutshell&#44 fill both buckets with fresh clean water&#44 and then nominate one as the 'fresh water' bucket&#44 and the other as the 'rinse' bucket. To wash a panel&#44 pick up some fresh water in the Wash Mitt from fresh water bucket&#44 and spray 1 or 2 sprays of PPBS directly onto the Wash Mitt. After you have washed the panel&#44 thoroughly rinse the wash mitt in the rinse bucket to remove all of the dirt from the mitt&#44 wring it out&#44 and then pick up fresh water from the fresh water bucket to wash the next panel. After washing the car&#44 the rinse bucket should be dirty&#44 but the wash bucket should be perfectly clean.</li></ol><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>You should always work from top to bottom&#44 and from the cleanest to the dirtiest places. No point in picking up the dirt from behind the wheel arches&#44 and then smearing it all over the bonnet and causing swirls!</p></span><ol class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionOrderedList\"" ><li>Wash the Turret (ie the roof&#44 pillars and glass)&#44 starting with the paint&#44 finishing with the glass&#44 and then wash the Bonnet&#44 Boot&#44 Back and finally the front of the car IN THAT ORDER! (cleanest to dirtiest)</li><li>Wash the sides of the car. Wash the top half of one side first&#44 then the top half of the other side&#44 and then do the lower halves&#44 and again in that order</li></ol><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>The method is simple. Start with a clean wash mitt&#44 and put it into the fresh water bucket to pick up fresh water. Spray 1 or 2 sprays (about 2ml) of PPBS (Paint Pampering Body Shampoo) onto the Wash Mott&#44 and wash one panel or less. Do not scrub&#44 do not apply pressure&#44 do not use circular motions&#44 and do not overlap your strokes&#44 you only need to touch each piece of paint once! So simply wipe over back and forth. Each panel should take in the order of 5 to 10 seconds. If you find that dirt is stuck on and cannot be removed that easily&#44 then this is a good indication that you need more wax!</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>After you have completed each panel (or part panel)&#44 rinse the wash mitt out in the rinse bucket  thoroughly&#44 wring it out&#44 and then pick up fresh clean water from the fresh water bucket and do the next panel. If you are using more than one mitt to wash the car&#44 swap mitts after each section</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Final Rinse</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Don't be fooled&#44 there is still a fair amount of dirt on your car&#44 it is caught up in the emulsion formed with the shampoo. The purpose of this final rinse is to remove the leftover shampoo (and all of the dirt that it has trapped) form the car. Rinse down the panels from top to bottom&#44 but pay special attention to nooks&#44 crannies&#44 panel gaps etc&#44 as they will be full of shampoo (and therefore dirt).</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Drying the car</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Use the WWDT (Final Inspection Waffle Weave Drying Towel) to dry the car. Fold the towel into eight (so you have 16 clean sides to use) and basically use one side to dry each panel. If the towel gets water-logged&#44 simply ring it out. Be careful about letting any parts of the towel touch the ground&#44 especially when you are drying the bottom parts of the car&#44 as this will just pick up dirt that you will then grind into your paint. Only dry your paint and trim with the WWDT&#44 not the wheels</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Finishing the wheels</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Use the supplied Wheel Nanofibre Cloth  and a little Gloss Boost sprayed onto the wheel to quickly go over each wheel and remove all traces of brake dust. Make sure that you get into all the nooks and crannies&#44 and get down low and look up so you can see all the bits you missed from looking from above. You should have removed 99% of all brake dust earlier&#44 this last step is essentially to pick up the last 1% and dry the wheels</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Apply Gloss Boost</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>If you want your freshly washed car to have a little extra sparkle and 'pop'&#44 then simply spend another 5 minutes and go over the whole car from top to bottom using Final Inspection Gloss Boost&#44 and a Microfibre Paint Cloth.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Fold the Microfibre cloth into 4. We only ever use the plush side of the cloth on the paint&#44 never the 'hard' side. If you fold the cloth into 4&#44 so that you have 2 plush sides on the outside&#44 use one side as the 'wet side' and the other as the 'dry side'</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Simply spray a very small amount of Gloss Boost onto a panel (Very Important: Less is more here&#44 you only need just one or two sprays and no more!) and then spread it over the panel evenly using the wet side of the cloth. Don't scrub! Don't apply any pressure! You are simply spreading the Gloss Boost evenly! Then&#44 straight away&#44 turn the cloth over and buff the panel dry with the dry side. Repeat this process over the whole car. </p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Spending 5 minutes to apply Gloss Boost to your car after washing will really add another dimension to how shiny your car will look.</p></span></div>",Final Inspection,Y,\N

TP-KIT-DPNTPRT,Deluxe Paintwork Protection and Maintenance Kit,97.0000,97.0000,97.0000,BasicPaintProtectionKit.jpg,"<div id=\""tigFIProductDescription\""><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionTitle\"">Deluxe Paintwork Protection and Maintenance Kit</span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>Why do I need this kit?</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>This kit contains everything you need to keep your car's paint protected and looking good for years. When used in conjunction with our recommended washing technique&#44 this kit will help you keep the paint swirl and blemish free. What's more&#44 it takes no more than 5 minutes after you have washed your car!</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Every car should have a protective layer of wax on it at all times. Doing so gives you the following benefits:</p></span><ul class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionUnorderedList\"" ><li>It protects your paintwork from the acids in Bird Poo&#44 which would otherwise easily etch into the paint.</li><li>It protects your paintwork from UV radiation&#44 which would otherwise burn your clear coat&#44 and leave it brittle&#44 and subject to cracking and peeling.</li><li>It keeps your car looking clean for longer. People often claim that dark cars are harder to keep clean&#44 but that is only true if wax is not used. With adequate wax protection&#44 dirt will find it much harder to stick to the surface&#44 and most of it will wash off in the rain&#44 so your car looks cleaner for longer</li></ul><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>The primary reason that people don't keep wax protection on their cars is that it takes too long to apply. That certainly USED to be the case&#44 but with the latest Final Inspection products&#44 that problem has been solved. A layer of wax can be applied in as little as 5 minutes!</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>When do I use this kit?</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>This kit is only to be used immediately after washing your car&#44 and not at any other time*.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>For argument's sake&#44 lets say that you wash your car every fortnight&#44 or 26 times in a year. For the first 3 washes&#44 apply a layer of Full Metal Jacket Spray Wax. So after the first 3 washes&#44 you will have 3 strong layers of wax to protect your paint. You won't need to reapply FMJSW now until the water beads start to flatten out&#44 anywhere from 6 to 12 months away.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>On the washes where you are not applying FMJSW&#44 apply Gloss Boost instead. It gives your car an awesome gloss coating that looks brilliant in the sun&#44 but adds very little protection on its own.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>What's included in the kit?</p></span><p><strong>2 x Paintwork Nanofibre Cloths:</strong> The Paintwork Nanofibre Cloth has a hard side and a soft side. NEVER use the hard side&#44 we only ever use the soft side to touch paintwork. Fold the cloth into 4 so that you have 2 soft sides. If you fold the other way&#44 you have 2 fresh soft sides. Cloths can be washed in the washing machine on the Synthetics cycle (preferably with a microfibre wash) and will last for many years if looked after.</p><p><strong>1 x Full Metal Jacket Spray Wax 275ml:</strong> One of the best spray-waxes on the market today. Application is a simple 5 minute process&#44 and will provide protection to your car's paint for months at a time. Provides essential protection againt bird-poo and UV radiation&#44 and adds a nice gloss finish. It can be used on paint&#44 glass (not windscreen) rubber and plastic.</p><p><strong>1 x Gloss Boost 500ml:</strong> This product offers very little protection to your paint&#44 it's primary purpose is to add Gloss&#44 which it does very well. Used in conjunction with FMJ Spray Wax&#44 it makes a formidible team.</p><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlockHeader\""><p>So are you gonna tell me how to use it&#44 or what?</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>PLEASE NOTE: As with all Final Inspection products&#44 a little goes a very long way. Most people believe that if a little bit does a good job&#44 then more must be better&#44 but this is not the case with FI products&#44 they are designed to be used sparingly. Using too much will make the products more difficult to use. If you are finding it difficult to buff off either of the products in this kit&#44 then you are using too much product! Try using half that amount.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>After every wash&#44 spend just 5 minutes to apply a layer of either FMJSW&#44 or Gloss Boost&#44 but never both.  FMJSW only needs to be used the first 3 times&#44 or when more wax is required&#44 and Gloss Boost is applied on every wash where FMJSW is not applied.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Both products are applied in exactly the same way:</p></span><ol class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionOrderedList\"" ><li>Fold the Paintwork Nanofibre Cloth into 4&#44 so that you have 2 soft sides. Nominally&#44 one side will be the 'dry' side&#44 and the other side will be the 'Wet' side.</li><li>Spray a little product directly onto a panel. One or 2 sprays is all that it takes per panel&#44 if you use too much it will be hard to buff off later.</li><li>Use the 'Wet' side of the cloth to spread the product evenly over the panel. This side of the cloth will now be Wet!</li><li>Flip the cloth over and buff the surface clean with the 'Dry' side of the cloth.</li><li>Repeat for every panel</li></ol><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>Once you have done this a couple of times and figured out how little product to use&#44 you will be able to do the whole car in around 5 minutes every time.</p></span><span class=\""tigFIProductDescriptionBlock\""><p>*You can use a little Gloss Boost and Paintwork Nanofibre Cloth to remove Bird-Poo as soon as possible. Be careful though&#44 as it is very easy to add swirls doing this&#44 so try to touch the paint as little as possible.</p></span></div>",Final Inspection,Y,\N
