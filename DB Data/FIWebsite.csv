        <p><strong>The Final Inspection Glass System&trade;&#44 a revolutionary new way to easily and quickly clean glass including tinted glass without chemical and without streaks&#44 smears or smudges.</strong></p>\
<p><strong></strong>All new for 2014&#44 the NanoFibre&trade; Glass System&trade; is the best tool for glass maintenance.</p>\
<p>Clean glass is part of a safe and comfortable driving experience and it is important to have clean glass constantly. Maintaining glass should be simple and easy and the Glass System makes this so.</p>\
<p>With it's generously sized components&#44 these tailored cloths will gently but effectively and efficiently remove weekly build-up of temporary contaminants from your vehicles glass surfaces without chemical.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Why NanoFibre?</strong></p>\
<p>The NanoFibre cloths deep clean and remove oils and dirt from the glass surface&#44 leaving nothing to cause streaks or smears.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Performance&#44 direction of use and glass cleaning information</strong></p>\
<p>The Glass System consists of two cloths&#44 a Step 1 and a Step 2.</p>\
<p>Step 1 is a Dark Green coloured absorbent cloth used first&#44 slightly damp&#44 to deep clean glass by removing oils and dirt&#44 pulling them away from the surface.</p>\
<p>Step 2 is a LIGHT GREEN tightly woven cloth used to remove any residual water on the glass surface and deliver a smear free finish.</p>\
<p>The best way to clean glass is to remove materials from the surface&#44 not add to the surface&#44 thus&#44 using glass cleaning chemicals is only recommended if your glass is heavily soiled and/or the debris requires some chemical to assist to break down the debris.</p>\
<p>Smearing occurs as a result of material left on the surface&#44 it is vital to use the best&#44 most absorbent cloth to remove all materials from the glass surface in order to achieve the highest clarity and transmission without any ghosting or smearing from thin deposits left on the glass surface. It is also important to use a dry&#44 tight woven cloth for finishing to atomise water and encourage evaporation of very small water particles to avoid visible watermarks.</p>\

<p><strong>Why a NanoFibre Applicator?</strong></p>\
<p>Unlike sponge&#44 a NanoFibre&trade; applicator is properly machine washable&#44 making it a much safer alternative.<br />Why?<br /> Sponges have thousands or millions of cells that catch and harbour debris and that debris is re-introduced to your surface with every wipe&#44 along with ever increasing marring as the sponge fills with swirl inducing particles. &nbsp;The plastic used to make foam is also agreessive and creates additional marring&#44 so even from the very first wipe&#44 a NanoFibre applicator is protecting your surfaces.</p>\
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>\
<p>This applicator is designed to prime faster while absorbing less product. It loads quickly with very little product&#44 but primes evenly and distributes consistently with ease.</p>\
<p>It has a small&#44 tight 'Hand Pocket' designed to reduce fatigue and a small surface area to reduce unnecessary product absorption and loss which is important when using expensive sealants or waxes.</p>\
<p>Very high quality NanoFibre with durable&#44 double foam core.</p>\
<p>The applicator consists entirely of Nanofibre with the exception of the foam core. &nbsp;Edging is Nanofibre&#44 not silk&#44 rayon&#44 nylon&#44 cotton or any other organic materials that mark glossy surfaces.</p>\
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\
<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>\
<p>Use the hand pocket applicator in conjunction with the drections on the product you are using it with. &nbsp;Usually&#44 for applying sealants and waxes&#44 a back and forth motion is recommended and overlapping grid for efficiency.</p>\
<p>The 'Hand Pocket' applicator is reversible&#44 simply pull the hand pocket over the top of the applicator&nbsp;</p>\

<p>- Spray directly onto cloths as a pre-soak immediately before washing</p>\
<p>- As a washing detergent for Microfibre and NanoFibre</p>\
<p>- As a soaking agent between use and wash for microfibre or NanoFibre products.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Direction of use</strong></p>\
<p>It is important to soak your cloths in water with a little peppermint immediately after use. &nbsp;Especially after using Microfibre or NanoFibre with products that will harden around fibres such as sealants and waxes&#44 it is extrememly importnat to immediately soak your cloths in a solution of (preferably warm) water and Peppermint to stop the waxes from bonding to the fibres.</p>\
<p>Final Inspection recommend preparing a bucket of 5-15Litres of water (depending on how many cloths will be soaked) with 2-6 caps of Peppermint disolved in it before starting any detailing work and saturating and soaking &nbsp;cloths as soon as possible after use&#44 especially with waxes before washing.<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> Clothes can be soaked overnight. &nbsp;This process will significantly assist in avoiding hardening fibres.</span></p>\
<p>- Never use fabric softeners to condition NanoFibre (&amp; Microfibre) Cloths.</p>\
<p>- Never wash NanoFibre (&amp; Microfibre) at water temps higher than 55deg C.</p>\
<p>- 'Spot' Stains by spraying Peppermint Wash directly onto NanoFibre (&amp; Microfibre) and allowing no more than 5 min dwelling time prior to washing. &nbsp;Do not allow Peppermint to dry on cloths.</p>\
<p>- Peppermint is very concentrated. &nbsp;1 Cap (20ml) of Peppermint Wash cleans up to 40 Cloths.</p>\
<p>- Do not overuse Peppermint by highly concentrating.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>NanoFibre Care</strong></p>\
<p>Care of all microfibre and nanofibre products involves removal of dirt and debris as soon as possible with gentle cleaners. &nbsp;Final Inspection recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"http://s164851.gridserver.com/peppermint\">'Peppermint'</a>&nbsp;anti-bacterial nanofibre wash solution&#44 using no more than 60deg water temperature. Never use fabric softeners for NanoFibre and always store NanoFibre in dry&#44 clean enviroments.</p>\

<p><strong>3.</strong> Remove polish with a NanoFibre Paintwork Cloth and Paint Cleanse and check surface for texture correction.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>NB:</p>\
<p>- If correction levels are yet to be reached&#44 repeat step 2 and 3.<br />- If correction levels are not ample with Velvet pads&#44 we recommend a Denim OPR pad.<br />- It is recommended to check film build levels with a PTT after texture correction for documentation.<br />- An interface pad may be used (between OPR pad and backing plate) for varied correction characteristics.</p>    ","Y",\N

        <p><strong>The Final Inspection Glass System&trade;&#44 a revolutionary new way to easily and quickly clean glass including tinted glass without chemical and without streaks&#44 smears or smudges.</strong></p>\
<p><strong></strong>All new for 2014&#44 the NanoFibre&trade; Glass System&trade; is the best tool for glass maintenance.</p>\
<p>Clean glass is part of a safe and comfortable driving experience and it is important to have clean glass constantly. Maintaining glass should be simple and easy and the Glass System makes this so.</p>\
<p>With it's generously sized components&#44 these tailored cloths will gently but effectively and efficiently remove weekly build-up of temporary contaminants from your vehicles glass surfaces without chemical.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Why NanoFibre?</strong></p>\
<p>The NanoFibre cloths deep clean and remove oils and dirt from the glass surface&#44 leaving nothing to cause streaks or smears.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Performance&#44 direction of use and glass cleaning information</strong></p>\
<p>The Glass System consists of two cloths&#44 a Step 1 and a Step 2.</p>\
<p>Step 1 is a Dark Green coloured absorbent cloth used first&#44 slightly damp&#44 to deep clean glass by removing oils and dirt&#44 pulling them away from the surface.</p>\
<p>Step 2 is a LIGHT GREEN tightly woven cloth used to remove any residual water on the glass surface and deliver a smear free finish.</p>\
<p>The best way to clean glass is to remove materials from the surface&#44 not add to the surface&#44 thus&#44 using glass cleaning chemicals is only recommended if your glass is heavily soiled and/or the debris requires some chemical to assist to break down the debris.</p>\
<p>Smearing occurs as a result of material left on the surface&#44 it is vital to use the best&#44 most absorbent cloth to remove all materials from the glass surface in order to achieve the highest clarity and transmission without any ghosting or smearing from thin deposits left on the glass surface. It is also important to use a dry&#44 tight woven cloth for finishing to atomise water and encourage evaporation of very small water particles to avoid visible watermarks.</p>\

<p>The Eraser&trade; is for random orbital machine use.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Directions of use</strong><br /> <strong></strong>For best results;</p>\

<p>With it's generous and comfortable shape and size&#44 this tailored moquet weave mitt will gently but effectively and efficiently remove weekly build-up of temporary contaminants from your vehicles surfaces.</p>\

<p><strong>Why NanoFibre?</strong></p>\
<p>Unlike a sponge&#44 a NanoFibre&trade; Mitt is properly machine washable&#44 making it a much safer alternative. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Sponges have thousands or millions of cells that catch and harbour debris and that debris is re-intoruced to your surface with every wash&#44 along with ever increasing marring as the sponge fills with swirl inducing particles. &nbsp;The plastic used to make foam is also agreessive and creates additional marring&#44 so even from the very first wipe&#44 a NanoFibre Mitt is protecting your surfaces.</p>\

<p>The Curvy Lady has an astonishing amount of the smallest multi-split nanofibre packed together to reach 600 gsm making it super absorbant and incredibly effecive at extracting and holding large amounts of fine debris and oils. &nbsp;Recommended for use on all exterior surfaces such as paint&#44 glass and plastics and even fabric soft tops.</p>\

<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong><strong><strong>Leather Clean Gel&trade;</strong></strong>&nbsp;delivers perfect results on the following materials</strong></p>\
<p>- All types of aniline leather<br />- All types of semi-aniline leather (most very high-end luxury vehicles)<br />- All types of PU coated leather&nbsp;(most mass-produced vehicles)</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>When should I clean my leather?</strong></p>\
<p>You should clean leather when it is required. &nbsp;Unlike feeding which is recommended once per month regardless of use&#44 there are no set time intervals for leather cleaning&#44 instead&#44 we recommend to maintain clean leather as it is necessary.</p>\
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\
<p><strong>Why is a dedicated <strong>cleaner</strong>&nbsp;and feeder better than an all in one product?</strong></p>\
<p>Replacing hydration at the same time as cleaning is a cumbersome and thus inefficient method of maintaining leather.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Dedicated cleaners should be used to remove debris before a moisturiser&#44 designed to sink deep into the leather&#44 is applied.</p>\
<p>It is highly recommended to clean leather&#44 however&#44 Final Inspection 'Feed' does contain a very small amount of cleaners designed to remove only very light soiling.</p>\
<p>For instanace&#44 for vehicles that aren't very dirty and/or aren't used very often&#44 it will be unnecessary to use a dedicated cleaner often.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>May I use leather clean in my home or office?</strong></p>\
<p>Of course&#44 leather 'Feed' may be used on all types of leather as part of good maintenance&#44 seperate products are not required for leather sofas etc.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Directions of use</strong><br /> <span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Video instructions available on the next tab</span></p>\
<p>If heavily soiled&#44 first wipe with a damp Final Inspection NanoFibre Interior Cloth&trade;.<br /> Fill a 5-10 litre bucket of warm water.</p>\
<p>Apply a small amount of Leather Clean Gel&trade; to a damp Final Inspection NanoFibre&nbsp;Applicator&trade; (yellow) and agitate dirty leather including stitching regularly checking how much dirt the applicator is absorbing.<br /> Regularly rinse applicator with warm water and regularly replace water.<br /> Once clean&#44 dry leather with a dry NanoFibre Interior Cloth&trade;.</p>\

<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>When should I re-hydrate to my leather?</strong></p>\
<p>You should replace lost moisutre every month regardless of how much or little use the vehicle has.</p>\
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\
<p><strong>Why is a dedicated feeder and cleaner better than an all in one product?</strong></p>\
<p>Dedicated cleaner should be used to remove debris before a moisturiser&#44 designer to sink deep into the leather is applied.</p>\
<p>It is highly recommended to clean leather&#44 however&#44 Final Inspection 'Feed' does contain a very small amount of cleaners designed to remove only very light soiling.</p>\
<p>For instanace&#44 for vehicles that aren't very dirty and/or aren't used very often&#44 it will be unnecessary to use a dedicated cleaner often.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>May I use Leather Feed in my home or office?</strong></p>\
<p>Of course&#44 Leather 'Feed' may be used on all types of leather as part of good maintenance&#44 separate products are not required for leather sofas etc.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>May I 'feed' vinyl or leatherette?</strong></p>\
<p>Whilst Final Inspection Leather Feed will not damage vinyl&#44 plastic&#44 MB Tech or any other kind of leatherette&#44 it is futile feeding these synthetic materials.</p>\
<p>Leather Feed won't be accepted by these materials and the surfaces will most likely remain greasy&#44 the product will then require removal or will be removed by clothing.</p>\
<p>Final Inspection suggests not moisturising vinyls with feed as well as cleaning them with Leather Clean Gel&#44 instead&#44 clean synthetic materials with Interior Cleanse for its superior cleaning power and reduced cost. &nbsp;Do not clean leather with Interior Cleanse.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><strong>Directions of use</strong></p>\
<p>1.&nbsp;Make sure all leather surfaces are clean and dry. &nbsp;If heavily soiled&#44 first clean with Final Inspection Leather Clean Gel&trade;. &nbsp;If lightly dusty or dirty&#44 wipe surfaces clean with a slightly damp Final Inspection NanoFibre&nbsp;Interior Cloth&trade;&nbsp;and allow to dry.</p>\
<p>2. For best results&#44 apply a coin-sized amount of Leather Feed&trade; onto a clean and dry Final Inspection NanoFibre Interior Applicator&trade; (yellow) and prime the applicator by spreading the feed around and into the applicator.<br /><br />3. Do not remove leather 'Feed' from leather&#44 instead&#44 allow up to 15min for leather to accept nourishment and return to a dry state with no gloss. &nbsp;If leather returns dry in less than 5mins&#44 it may require more hydration&#44 it is recommended to re-apply by carrying out processes in step 2.</p>\

        <p>Hand Pocket Applicator - Leather The Leather Hand Pocket Applicator makes applying Leather Feed a breeze. The Low Pile Weave doesn't unnecessarily absorb product that eventually is wasted. The Low Pile also allows the Hand Pocket to glide across the rough Leather surface instead of gripping. It does however have enough pile to evenly distribute the Feeding product onto Leather surfaces. For use with all Leather Feeding/Conditioning/Moisturising products that are in paste or thicker liquid form.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>The very best interior 'hand pocket' applicator for cleaning or application of leather preservers such as 'feed'.<br /><br /></p>\

<p><strong>Why a NanoFibre Applicator?</strong></p>\
<p>Unlike sponge&#44 a NanoFibre&trade; applicator is properly machine washable&#44 making it a much safer alternative.<br />Why?<br />Sponges have thousands or millions of cells that catch and harbour debris and that debris is re-introduced to your surface with every wipe&#44 along with ever increasing marring as the sponge fills with swirl inducing particles. &nbsp;The plastic used to make foam is also agreessive and creates additional marring&#44 so even from the very first wipe&#44 a NanoFibre applicator is protecting your surfaces.</p>\
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>\
<p>This applicator is designed to prime faster while absorbing less product. It loads quickly with very little product&#44 but primes evenly and re-distributes products such as 'feed' consistently with ease.</p>\
<p>It has a small&#44 tight 'Hand Pocket' designed to reduce fatigue and a small surface area to reduce unnecessary product absorption and loss which is important when using expensive products.</p>\
<p>Very high quality NanoFibre with durable&#44 double foam core.</p>\
<p>The applicator consists entirely of Nanofibre with the exception of the foam core. &nbsp;Edging is Nanofibre&#44 not silk&#44 rayon&#44 nylon&#44 cotton or any other organic materials that mark glossy surfaces. &nbsp;You will find no nasty 'edgeless' technology in any of our NanoFibre products.</p>\
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\
<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>\
<p>Use the hand pocket applicator in conjunction with the drections on the product you are using it with. &nbsp;Usually&#44 for applying leather conditioners&#44 a slightly overlapping&nbsp;back and forth motion is recommended.</p>\
<p>The 'Hand Pocket' applicator is reversible&#44 simply pull the hand pocket over the top of the applicator&nbsp;</p>\
